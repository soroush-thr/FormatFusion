# Logo Placeholder

To add your logo to FormatFusion:

1. Create or obtain a logo image file
2. Name it "logo.png" 
3. Place it in this directory (resources/logo.png)
4. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Size: 64x64 or 128x128 pixels
   - Style: Should work well on dark backgrounds
   - Colors: Consider using light colors or white for visibility

The application will automatically detect and use your logo in:
- The main drag-and-drop area
- Window title bar (if implemented)
- About dialog (if implemented)

If no logo is found, the application will display a fallback icon (ðŸ”„).
